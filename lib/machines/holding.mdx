# Authentication

This state machine handles authentication logic when using an external service, for instance AWS Amplify.

## Initial Check

We start off in <State>checkingIfLoggedIn</State>. This state fires off an service which goes and checks if the user is logged in or not, asynchronously.

- If <Event>REPORT_IS_LOGGED_OUT</Event> gets triggered, we end up in <State>loggedOut</State>
- If <Event>REPORT_IS_LOGGED_IN</Event> gets triggered, we end up in <State>loggedIn</State>
  - We also save some user details into context via <Action>assignUserDetailsToContext</Action>

## Logged Out

Once the user is <State>loggedOut</State>, we can log them back in with <Event>LOG_IN</Event>.

Any time the user enters <State>loggedOut</State>, we fire off <Action>navigateToAuthPage</Action> to send them to the login page.

## Logged In

In the initial check, if <Event>REPORT_IS_LOGGED_IN</Event> gets triggered, we end up in <State>loggedIn</State>. From there the user can also log out with <Event>LOG_OUT</Event>.
